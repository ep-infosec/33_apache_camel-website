The Camel community announces the immediate availability of Camel 2.25.4, a new patch release with 10 fixes and improvements.

The artifacts are published and ready for you to download from Maven Central. For more details please take a look at the [release notes](/releases/release-2.25.4/).

Please note that the 2.x major version will reach end-of-life (EOL) by January 2022. We plan to release a final Camel 2.25.5 version around that time and include some final patches and dependency upgrades. After that, we will no longer support Camel 2.x.

Many thanks to all who made this release possible.

On behalf of the Camel PMC,
Gregor Zurowski
